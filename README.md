# FacebookPlaces3DTour
Web app for a 3D tour in Unity through Facebook Places using GPS.

# Overview
This is a project that I developed with my colleague Simone Magistri for the Multimedia Design and Production course at the University of Florence during my Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering. The assignment required to map a chosen type of data extracted from a social network and in a 3D environment in Unity. 
We chose to create a coordinate-based and explorable 3D world and to populate it with 3D marks that stands for Facebook Places.
