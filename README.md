# FacebookPlaces3DTour
Web app for a 3D tour in Unity through Facebook Places using GPS.

# Overview
This is a project that I developed for the Multimedia Design and Production course at the University of Florence during my Bachelor Degree in Computer Engineering. The assignment required to map a chosen type of data extracted from a social network and in a 3D environment in Unity.
I chose to create a coordinate-based and explorable 3D world and to populate it with 3D marks that stands for Facebook Places, enabling a player to navigate into the world and interact with them.

# Implementation
The implementation of the solution is the following: the user is enabled to control the player (make it walk, run or jump) through the keyboard arrows and can interact with a place just clicking on it. A pop-up will then appear with place-related information and a link to the correspondent Facebook page.

## APIs
In order to retrieve places information it was used the Facebook [API Place Graph](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/places), making a query for the nearest places in a radius of 5km.

Places have been modeled with [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/) in order to obtain a 3D object that represents faithfully a traditional place icon used in maps.
