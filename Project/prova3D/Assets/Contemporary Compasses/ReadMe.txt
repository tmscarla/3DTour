Compass Pack ReadMe

Step 1
Add the compass prefab of your choice to the scene.

Step 2
Under the ‘script’ component of the ‘Hands’ object, assign a PlayerController to the ‘player’ field.

That Simple!

Notes
Any prefabs labelled ‘ - reversed’ move the outside of the compass instead of the inside.
